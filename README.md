# Checkers
**Mason Holaska**

This is my first project using **Next.js** as well as **React**, I've only worked with vanilla javascript previously and decided this was a good way to learn how to use state.

## Version 1.0
- Gameboard and pieces were added
- Pieces can move to their available spaces as well as perform single jumps over opponent, although the opponent is not removed from the board yet
